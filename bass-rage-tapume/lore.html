      <h1>The History of<br />The Legion</h1>

      <p>
        300 years ago, the human race was almost wiped out by a series of natural and technological disasters. With few
        survivors, humanity worked hard to find a solution. Finally, they discovered a portal to a new world inhabited
        by the Valurians, an advanced and peaceful species. However, not everything went as planned.
      </p>

      <p>
        When humans appeared in Valrur, they were met with hostility by the Valurians. Encounters between the two races
        always ended in conflict, and humans eventually developed advanced powers and technologies that helped them
        confront the Valurians. Over time, a group of powerful humans joined together and formed The Legion, a team
        dedicated to protecting and expanding human interests in Valrur.
      </p>

      <img src="./images/3.png" />
      <p>
        They devised a plan called Ground Zero, which involved invading one of Valrur's great metropolises, called
        Zalvoria. Before the invasion of the Zalvoria metropolis, The Legion members gathered and combined their powers
        to create a dimensional rift in the middle of the city. They planned to open the rift and enter the city through
        it, thus avoiding the Valurian defenses that protected the conventional entrances.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the members of The Legion gathered to invade the metropolis of Zalvoria, another member of the team, an
        infiltration and intelligence expert named Sieforjn, was on a solitary mission. He had discovered a mysterious
        city in a remote corner of Valrur and decided to investigate to uncover its secrets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sieforjn spent days infiltrating the city, lurking in the shadows and avoiding detection by Valurian patrols. He
        discovered that the city was a secret military research center, where Valurian scientists conducted bizarre
        experiments on living beings, seeking to create biological weapons for use in their wars.
      </p>

      <p>
        While exploring the laboratory corridors, Sieforjn saw horrible things - humans and other creatures locked in
        cages, subjected to cruel tests and experiments. He shrank back in fear, but also felt a wave of anger and
        sadness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sieforjn continued his exploration, skulking through the shadows and unraveling the secrets of the facility. He
        found several bizarre experiments, such as the nectar that made living beings follow whoever used it like bees,
        and the dog that could disappear without a trace, becoming invisible.
      </p>

      <p>
        With this new information in hand, Sieforjn decided to report his findings to The Legion. He knew they needed to
        be aware of the horrors that were happening in the shadows.
      </p>

      <img src="./images/4.png" />
      <p>
        The rift opened with a loud boom, and The Legion members jumped through it, entering the city undetected. They
        moved quickly through the corridors, taking down Valurian robots and avoiding security patrols. As they
        approached the center of the city, the battle began to intensify, with the Valurians gathering around the
        invading team.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, The Legion members reached the heart of the city, where a massive metal structure rose towards the sky.
        They combined their powers once again and created an even larger rift, slicing the structure in half. The impact
        was tremendous, and the city shook with the force of the blow. The Valurians went on high alert, but it was too
        late.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the city's structure shattered, The Legion team advanced, facing Valurian defenses with powerful blows and
        spells. The battle was intense, with fire and lightning powers exploding in all directions. Valurian robots flew
        through the air, and entire buildings crumbled around them.
      </p>

      <img src="./images/5.png" />
      <p>
        In the end, Phantom emerged, decimating all the robots in the city with overwhelming force. The Valurians on
        site were shocked, unsure of what to do in the face of Phantom's power.
      </p>

      <img src="./images/6.png" />
      <p>
        The Legion explored the metropolis and found ancient ruins with several inscriptions. They deciphered the
        language and activated a magic book, which caught the attention of an alien ship that appeared above the
        metropolis.
      </p>

      <img src="./images/7.png" />
      <p>
        A goddess warrior named Galladriel descended from the ship and declared herself the Hunter. She told The Legion
        that their adventure was just beginning, because in Valrur, a mythical being named Baloonni had been awakened by
        magic.
      </p>

      <img src="./images/8.png" />
      <p>
        Hunter explained that Baloonni was an extremely powerful and dangerous being that had been sealed away for a
        long time. With magic being used again in Valrur, it had been released and posed a threat to all races on the
        planet. The Legion decided that they needed to act and find a way to stop Baloonni.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the arrival of the Hunter and the discovery of other worlds through the multiversal portals that opened
        during the battle, The Legion realized that Baloonni's threat was greater than they had imagined. With the
        possibility that the creature could affect other universes, the team joined forces with other races to combat
        the threat.
      </p>

      <img src="./images/9.png" />
      <p>
        The Hunter introduced allies, Nilfheim and Galaxion, worlds that had been affected by Baloonni's activities. The
        inhabitants of these worlds joined the fight and together formed an army to face the threat.
      </p>

      <p>
        After their last battle in Zalvoria, Nisenjugo and Mint were searching for Baloonni and new multiversal portals.
      </p>

      <p>
        During one of their travels, they came across a city called Lork, which was completely closed off and surrounded
        by a multiversal portal. The portal opened a rift where Japanese people were trying to contact the Valurians for
        knowledge exchange between multiverses, but the Valurians were refusing and imprisoning anyone who crossed the
        portal, fighting to defend the city of Lork.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without hesitation, Nisenjugo decided to help the Japanese defend the portal. Mint, on the other hand, went in
        search of a Japanese assassin spy who was infiltrated among the Valurians and could trigger a huge war between
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nisenjugo and Mint worked together to prevent a war. Finally, they managed to close the multiversal portal,
        preventing the war.
      </p>

      <img src="./images/10.png" />
      <p>
        As a reward for helping the city against the multiversal portal, Mint was allowed by the Valurians to see the
        ruins beneath the city, where he discovered that Baloonni could be controlled by a magical flower called White
        Lily.
      </p>

      <p>
        He set off alone in search of the flower to prevent further disasters, and he found it and used it against
        Baloonni, finally controlling it after it devastated a city.
      </p>

      <img src="./images/11.png" />
      <p>
        Using Baloonni's psychic powers, he began to help the nearby Valurians, until the arrival of The Legion, who,
        after seeing Mint controlling Baloonni, did not accept such an act, as he could still break free from the magic
        of White Lily, which was not infinite.
